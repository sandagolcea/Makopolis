Objectives
-----
* Create an MVP in three days
* Test Driven Development
* Learning team skills
* Learn about planning and design


##technologies
* Javascript
* JQuery
* NODEjs, Express
* Html
* CSS
* Git
* Heroku
* Jasmine
* Casper, Mocha, Chai, Grunt
* WebSockets

MVP Requirements
---------------
- [x] Make a single player game with one character who goes on a coding journey from start to finish!
- [x] The character is animated
- [x] Questions appear on the page using JQuery

Enhancements
------------
If we had more time to work on this project, the features we would like to have added would be:
- [ ] Two player functionality using web sockets (multiplayer with sockets, turn implementation)
- [ ] The ability to ask questions that weren't multiple choice - real life coding problems
- [ ] A more responsive web page that isn't affected by resizing (improve css display (numbers could be attached to SVG elements))
- [ ] Timer for the questions (e.g.: 10 sec/question)
- [ ] Questions could be either from a github repo or transmitted in JSON format (hardcoded atm)
